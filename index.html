Ques.1 Difference between flex row and column

Ans: 1. Flex Direction: Row (Default)

Main Axis: Horizontal (left to right in left-to-right languages).

Cross Axis: Vertical (top to bottom).

Child elements are arranged in a horizontal line, one next to another.

Example:


.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row; /* Default */
}

2. Flex Direction: Column

Main Axis: Vertical (top to bottom).

Cross Axis: Horizontal (left to right).

Child elements are stacked in a vertical column.

Example:


.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}










Ques.2 Explain inline , internal and external stylesheet Justify-content allows you to do what?

Ans: These are three methods to apply CSS to an HTML document:

1. Inline Styles

Definition: CSS is applied directly to the HTML element using the style attribute.

Usage: Ideal for quick changes or styling a single element.

Example:

<p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">This is an inline style.</p>

Advantages:

Easy to apply.

Good for testing or one-off styling.


Disadvantages:

Difficult to maintain for large projects.

Doesn't separate content and design.


2. Internal Stylesheet

Definition: CSS is written within a <style> tag inside the <head> of the HTML document.

Usage: Useful for styling a single webpage.

Example:

<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: red;
      font-size: 18px;
    }
  </style>
</head>

Advantages:

All styles for the page are centralized.

No need for external files.


Disadvantages:

Cannot reuse styles across multiple pages.

Adds to the HTML document's size.



3. External Stylesheet

Definition: CSS is written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML document using the <link> tag.

Usage: Best for large projects and multiple webpages.

Example:

<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>

styles.css:

p {
  color: green;
  font-size: 20px;
}

Advantages:

Styles can be reused across multiple pages.

Maintains separation of content and design.


Disadvantages:

Requires an additional HTTP request to load the file.









Ques.3 Difference between absolute and relative positioning

Ans: Absolute and relative positioning are two CSS positioning techniques used to control the placement of HTML elements on a webpage. Here's a comparison of the two:

1. Relative Positioning (position: relative;)

Positioning Reference: The element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow.

Effect:

Moves the element without affecting the surrounding elements, which stay in their original places.

If no top, right, bottom, or left values are specified, the element remains in its normal position.


Use Case: Used when you want to create slight adjustments to an element's position while keeping it in the normal document flow.

Impact on Flow: The element still occupies space in the document flow.


Example:

<div style="position: relative; top: 10px; left: 20px;">
  This div is shifted 10px down and 20px to the right.
</div>

2. Absolute Positioning (position: absolute;)

Positioning Reference: The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with position: relative, absolute, or fixed), or the viewport if no positioned ancestor exists.

Effect:

Completely removed from the normal document flow.

Does not affect or get affected by surrounding elements.

Positioned exactly based on the top, right, bottom, and left properties.


Use Case: Useful for creating overlays, tooltips, or precise element placement independent of other elements.

Impact on Flow: The element does not occupy space in the document flow.


Example:

<div style="position: relative;">
  <div style="position: absolute; top: 10px; left: 20px;">
    This div is positioned 10px down and 20px to the right of the parent div.
  </div>
</div>

Key Differences

Visual Summary:

Relative: Adjust the position of an element slightly but it keeps its original space in the flow.

Absolute: Position the element exactly where you want, and it does not affect or occupy space in the layout.









Ques.4 What is the z-index in CSS?

Ans: The z-index property in CSS is used to control the stacking order of elements on a webpage along the z-axis (perpendicular to the screen). It determines which elements appear in front of or behind others when they overlap.

Key Points About z-index:

1. Default Stacking Context:

By default, elements are stacked in the order they appear in the HTML, with later elements displayed on top.

z-index allows you to override this default behavior.



2. Usage:

Elements with higher z-index values are displayed in front of elements with lower values.

The z-index property only works on elements with a positioning context (i.e., position: relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky).



3. Values:

auto: The default value; the element’s stack level is determined by its order in the document.

Integer values: Positive or negative numbers. Higher numbers appear on top.

Negative values place the element behind other elements.



4. Stacking Context:

A stacking context is created when certain conditions are met (e.g., using position with a z-index or other CSS properties like opacity).

Elements inside a stacking context are layered within it, but this stacking is independent of other stacking contexts.



Example

<div style="position: relative; z-index: 1; background-color: red; width: 100px; height: 100px;">
  Red Box (z-index: 1)
</div>
div style="position: relative; z-index: 2; background-color: blue; width: 100px; height: 100px; margin-top: -50px;">
  Blue Box (z-index: 2)
</div>

In this example:

The blue box will appear in front of the red box because it has a higher z-index.


When to Use z-index

Creating overlapping layouts like modals, tooltips, or dropdowns.

Resolving stacking issues where one element unintentionally overlaps another.


Best Practices

Use z-index sparingly to avoid complex stacking issues.

Keep stacking contexts organized and predictable to prevent bugs.








Ques.5 What is the difference between padding and margin?

Ans: Padding and margin are both CSS properties used for spacing around elements, but they serve different purposes and affect different areas.


1. Padding

Definition: Padding is the space inside an element, between its content and its border.

Effect: Increases the size of the element by adding space inside its boundary.

Purpose: Used to create space between the content and the edge of the element (e.g., text and the border of a button).

Impact: Expands the element's size without affecting the spacing between elements.


Example:

div {
  padding: 20px; /* Adds 20px of space inside the element's border */
}

Visual Representation:

[ Border ]
   Padding
      Content


2. Margin

Definition: Margin is the space outside an element, between its border and other elements.

Effect: Creates space around an element, separating it from other elements.

Purpose: Used to control the distance between elements on the page.

Impact: Does not increase the element's size, only affects spacing between elements.


Example:
div {
    margin: 20px; /* Adds 20px of space outside the element */
  }
  
  Visual Representation:
  
  [ Margin ]
     Border
        Content
  
  
  Key Differences
  
  Example Combining Both
  
  div {
    padding: 10px; /* Space inside the border */
    margin: 20px;  /* Space outside the element */
    border: 2px solid black;
  }
  
  Here:
  
  Padding creates space between the content and the border.

  Margin creates space between this div and other elements.
